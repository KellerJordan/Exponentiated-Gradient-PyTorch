# Exponentiated-Gradient-PyTorch

Implementation of the exponentiated gradient (EG) algorithm with positive and negative weights in PyTorch. This optimizer can be used like any other to train PyTorch models, and performs comparably to gradient-descent based methods. The EG algorithm was introduced in [1].
